# Mechanics of frictional rods.
<img src="\images\bandeau_jersey.jpg" width="500">

Many systems (for example yarn, ropes, knots, textiles, birdnests, ...) are made of elastic rods in contact. The mechanical properties of these objects result on the one hand from the elasticity properties of these objects, and on the other hand from frictional contacts between them.

I am interested in the mechanical properties of this type of system, by using numerical
 models of discrete elastic rods with frictional contacts.
