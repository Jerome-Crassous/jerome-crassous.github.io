We were interested in deformation fluctuations within a shear band, i.e. when the granular material is in stationary flow, beyond the precursors to fracture. We were able to demonstrate that deformation takes place in a highly intermittent manner, with spatial and temporal fluctuations in deformation.

This situation suggests an analogy with plate tectonics, where deformations of the Earth's crust are localized along faults and occur, among other things, as discrete movements generating earthquakes. We wanted to develop this analogy. To this end, we collaborated with geophysicists from the Isterre laboratory (Observatoire des Sciences de l'Univers de Grenoble, INSU) to test this analogy. The results of this study showed a remarkable analogy between the statistics of microstrain in a shear band and the statistical laws of natural earthquakes1. This experimental system is thus probably one of the best laboratory implementations of a device reproducing natural faults. Existing systems either fail to image events, or do not reproduce the complex statistics of natural events.
